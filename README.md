# About
I have five main devices in my homelab: a compute heavy server that I run Proxmox on, a storage server that I run TrueNas Scale on, a mini-pc that I run OPNsense on, a rasberry pi that I use for running adguard, and a cisco SG200-26 that I use for managing all my vlans. I run almost all of my services on docker, and I have those configs listed here.
